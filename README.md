### About
	• This is an interactive game for web browsers.This app will dynamically update my HTML page with the jQuery library.
        • The player will have to guess the answer. In this game, the player will have to guess numbers.
  
### Instructions 
  
   * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
   * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
   * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
   * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
   * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
