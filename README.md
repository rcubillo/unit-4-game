### About
    • This is an interactive game for web browsers. This app will dynamically update my HTML 
    page with the jQuery library.
    • The player will have to guess the answer. In this game, the player will have to guess numbers.
  
### Instructions 
  
    • There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
    • The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
    • When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total 
    score. 
    • Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
    • When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
    • The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
    • The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
    • The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
    • When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will 
    have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
    • The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the 
    page as a means to restart the game. 

### How-to use this code
    You will need to add your own MongoDB database as well as mailing server information.
