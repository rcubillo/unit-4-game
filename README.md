### About
    •Crystal-Collector-Game is a Javascript app that uses the Math.floor(Math.random()) function
    to generate a random target number between 19 and 120. There are 4 crystals displayed on the screen.
    For each round, the user will receive a new target number, and each crystal will be assigned a new 
    value. The user does not know the crsyal value until clicking on it. The goal for the user is to click 
    on different crystals so that the sum adds up to the target number for that round.
  
### Instructions 
  
    • There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
    • The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game and it should be between 19 - 120..
    • When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total 
    score
    • Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.. 
    • Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
    • When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
    • The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
    • The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
    • The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
    • When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will 
    have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
    • The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the 
    page as a means to restart the game.
